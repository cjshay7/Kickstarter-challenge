# KICKSTARTER CHALLENGE

##**Overview of Project**

#Louise is a fundraiser and has experienced a multitude of outcomes with the campaigns she has launched. Some campaingns were successful, some failed and others were cancelled. One play in particular, **_'Fever"_** came close to its fundraising goal is a fairly short amount of time. 

#Louise wants to perform some analysis to gian insight on how other campaingns faired in comparion to the **_'Fever"_** campaign. Charts and pivot tables will give a visual representation of the **Outcomes Based on Launch Date** and **Outcomes based on Goal**. 

#**Outcomes Based on Launch Date**

##**Purpose**
#The purpose of this analysis is to show the campign outcomes based on a launch date.....successful, failed and canceled. A pivot table was created with Category and Years filters and the results illustrated in a chart based on filter appied in the pivot table. 

##**Analysis**
#The first step in the campaign analysis was to use the StarterBook file used in classwork assignmen and rename to **Kickstarter Ghallenge**. Next I added a column titled Years and use the Year function to extract the year from the Date Created Column. Using the Kickstarter worksheet, I created a pivot table on a new worksheet titled **Theater Outcomes by Launch Date**. Filters were applied based on Theater category and all Years with Canceled, Failed, Successful column labels. The Date Created Conversion was place in the Rows area and grouped to only show the month.

#Using the pivot table, a line chart was created to give a visual representation of the relationship between various outcomes and the launch month.
